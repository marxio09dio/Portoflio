            A game developer approached me to get insights into the Steam Store world. The goal was to understand where to best allocate resources to develop a successful game. <br>
            As a gamer myself, I was really excited for this project and was really into it, maybe because this was part of my imaganition, but I digress... <br>
          </p>           
          <p>  
            The first step was to obtain the data; for this, there were several options and different sources for each type of data. <br>
            After that, the data was analyzed, and a report was provided, including an interactive dashboard where the developer could also interact with the data. <br>
          </p>
          <h1 class="subheading">Obtaining the Data</h1>
          <p>
            After exploring multiple alternatives, I came across an excellent project by <a href="https://github.com/nik-davis/steam-data-science-project">nik-davis</a> (maybe this is where I also got my inspiration).
            This data was excellent, but it was outdated (more than 4 years old), so, as the Python noob that I am, I decided to get my own data: <br>
            <ul>
            <li>First, I got the list of the App IDs that are present on the Steam Store from the <a href="https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetAppList/v2/">API URL</a></li>
            <li>With all the IDs collected, I got to work by getting all the data from each url of the Steam store: "https://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails/?appids=<i>appid</i>"</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://steamspy.com/api.php">The Steam Spy API</a> was used to collect data like Positive and Negative Reviews and the Peak Players for yesterday (yes, literally the day before getting the data, not when you are reading this).</li>
            <li>To get a count of the peak players of all time, well, I had to do a bit of scraping from the website <a href= "https://steamplayercount.com">. Steam Player Count</a></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
